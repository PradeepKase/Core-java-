Q1. Explain the difference between == operator and equals() method
with a code example.

if we use == in code to the jvm is check for its location(address) of those class or variable.
It wont compare the content inside variable;

Ex: public class Test{
public static void main(String[] args){
String s1="Pradeep";
String s2="Pradeep";

	if(s1==s2){
	System.out.println("same");
	}
	else{
	System.out.println("same");
	}
      }
    }
}
 output=same
 because the java will check into String pool if there exsit same value string
 the jvm will refernce to the already existe steing.

if we want check content inside s1 and s2 we have to use .equals() methods.
