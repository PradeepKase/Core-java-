Q3.
 What is the significance of using the final keyword with the following programming
constructs.
a. variable
b. method
c. class

ANS: we can use final to tell the variable,method,class value is final.
like: RBI have final interset rate for many banks and all the banks will follow this method.
inshort- we use this final keyword when we no need to change value.(fixed value or method)
Final keyword can be applied to varibales,methods, and claases also and it has diffrent meaning in each consequences.

a.  variable:  

publuic static void main (sting[] args){

int i=15;
i++
// NO error becasue its normal int and crement it.

if we add final keyword in like:
final int i=15;
i++;    // error because used final keyword here cant change or update the int i(we can assaign value once)

b. method:

class A{
void nonofinalmethod(){
sysout(" it works normal)
}  //no error 

method with Final keyword:

final void nonofinalmethod(){
sysout(" it works normal)
} // Error we cant Over ride this method becasue it is final
ex: the RBI can use this method to finaliae interest rate;

c. class:

if the class is with final keyword it cannot be extended like(parent child class)
it will give compile error;

ex:
final class Animal{
}

class Dog extends Animal{
}// give error cant extend because usek keywoed final at the class.
