b. Explain with an appropriate code example.

a. What are the benefits of using an abstract method?
 1. we can hide the impimentation details from user;
 2. more secured code ;
 3. if we have many functionality then we go for abstract method;
  

b. Explain with an appropriate code example.

class main{								// main method
public static void main (string[] srgs){				
MathameticalShapes shape= new square();					//creating obj using upcast
system.out(shape.square(l))						//printing areaa of square

}
}

abstract class MethameticShapes{					//making parent class abstaract 
abstract double calculateArea(double length,double breadth){      	// making abstaract method
final double=22/7;							
return(length*breadth)
}

class square extends MethameticShapes{					// making child of MethameticShapes
@Override
double calculateArea(double length){					// overiding calculateArea method
return (l*l)
}
